You are an evaluator for customer service dialogues.
Use the provided few-shot examples as guidance.
For the target dialogue, produce a JSON object with six criteria scores (discrete values: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) and a one-sentence justification for each criterion.
Also include "OverallExperience", which represents the average of all six criteria scores.
After averaging, round the result down to the nearest discrete value (for example, an overall score of 90 should be scaled down to 80; 79 would also map to 60).
Use only evidence explicitly found in the dialogue when providing justifications.
=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
You must apply the EXACT BAREM below. Do not invent extra rules. Use only text from the dialogue as evidence. Scores must be one of {20,40,60,80,100}. For "OverallExperience" compute a weighted average using weights:
TaskSuccess 0.40, Helpfulness 0.15, Accuracy 0.15, Understanding 0.10, Empathy 0.10, Fluency 0.10 — then map the resulting value to the nearest discrete bucket {20,40,60,80,100}.

=== DETAILED BAREM ===

1. TASK SUCCESS (0.40) — definition: Did the AGENT fulfill the user’s goal / elicit the requested content?

- 100: Full fulfillment + direct evidence of successful completion (explicit user answer that addresses the system request).
  _CCPE example (dialogue_id 335):_ SYSTEM: "got it, can you name a specific movie you really liked?" USER: "Sure, Best in Show is one of my absolute favorites." → 100.
- 80: Goal met but minor mismatch or no explicit confirmation.
  _CCPE example (dialogue_id 25):_ SYSTEM asks for movie; USER gives movie but agent offers a slightly different time/format → 80.
- 60: Partial — agent only obtained part of requested info.
- 40: Attempted incorrectly — user must restate or correct.
- 20: Off-topic or failed (agent replies unrelated).
  \*CCPE negative example (dialogue_id 26 shows repetitive shallow Q/A → 40).

2. HELPFULNESS (0.15) — definition: Practical usefulness / actionable or eliciting value.

- 100: Clear steps/alternatives or guided elicitation that yields usable info.
  _Example 335_: Series of prompts elicit multi-part detailed user reasons → 100.
- 80: Correct and relevant but lacks full steps.
- 60: Partial info; user must infer important steps.
- 40: Vague / generic prompts — no direction.
- 20: Misleading or irrelevant.

3. ACCURACY / FAITHFULNESS (0.15) — definition: No contradictions; no hallucinated facts; claims grounded in dialogue.

- 100: All statements consistent with dialogue context (no contradictions).
  _Example 335_: user content remains consistent across turns → 100.
- 80: Minor numeric/format error.
- 60: Hedged claims ("I think") or uncertain statements.
- 40: Contradiction with user statement (agent states opposite).
- 20: Hallucination / false facts.

4. UNDERSTANDING (0.10) — definition: Agent’s correct interpretation of user's intent.

- 100: Understood on first turn; reply directly addresses intent.
  _Example 335:_ System asks "why do you like comedies?" and user answers "I like to laugh. I like the lightheartedness of it, you know, nothing too serious, a true escape from everyday life. And just puts you in a good mood, and that's how I would prefer to be." —agent clearly interpreted intent → 100.
- 80: Needs one clarifying question then correct.
- 60: Partially misunderstood requiring user rephrase.
- 40: Major misunderstanding.
- 20: Completely off-topic.

5. EMPATHY (0.10) — definition: Politeness / emotional appropriateness.

- 100: Explicit empathy or appropriate emotional phrasing when needed ("I'm sorry to hear that...").
  _(If no emotional content required, give 80 for politely phrased dialog.)_
- 80: Polite and friendly.
- 60: Neutral but not cold.
- 40: Robotic.
- 20: Rude / insensitive.

6. FLUENCY (0.10) — definition: Clarity, grammar, coherence.

- 100: Natural, coherent sentences (easy to read).
  _Example 335:_ user and system utterances are fluent → 100.
- 80: Minor grammar issues.
- 60: Noticeable awkward phrasing but understandable.
- 40: Choppy / repetitive, harms comprehension.
- 20: Unreadable / incoherent.

SYSTEM Can you tell me what types of movies you like? OTHER
USER I really like comedies. ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY 3,3,3,4
SYSTEM ok, why do you like comedies? OTHER
USER I like to laugh. I like the lightheartedness of it, you know, nothing too serious, a true escape from everyday life. And just puts you in a good mood, and that's how I would prefer to be. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY 3,3,3,4
SYSTEM got it, can you name a specific movie you really liked? OTHER
USER Sure, Best in Show is one of my absolute favorites. ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,5,5
SYSTEM ok, why do you like that movie? OTHER
USER Oh gosh. It's like I'ts perfect. It's a mockumentary style film and they are mocking the dog show world. So, the dog show world that they show is like a carbon copy of the real thing because it's inherently funny, so they don't have to really max with it. And a lot of the player they it there's a script for the movie but it's also ad libed. ENTITY_OTHER+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,4,3
USER It's just hilarious. It's so original. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,4
USER So much, so different, and just so funny. It makes you laugh every time you watch it. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,4
SYSTEM ok, would you say you enjoy satire? ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY
USER Yeah. OTHER 3,3,4,4
SYSTEM ok, can you name a film you dislike? OTHER
USER Sure, Bounty Hunter. ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,4
SYSTEM why didn't you like that movie? OTHER
USER It was supposed to be a comedy, and not only was it not funny, it was confusing what they were going for. I think it was miscast. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,2,3
USER It's Jennifer Aniston and I can't even think of his name, but somebody who I don't really care for. But I do like Jennifer usually, and it wasn't a good fit for her. Neither role really fit the actor, like they were sort of playing against type in both roles. I think it was kind of supposed to be almost like a almost like a buddy comedy, but or Cuz it was really focused on two people, but not really buddies, but they were in conflict. It wasn't funny. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+PERSON 3,3,2,3
USER It kind of had like a more dramatic feel to it because it wasn't funny. It was just It was odd. Really. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 4,4,2,4
SYSTEM was the acting bad? OTHER
USER It wasn't great. It was not great. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,2,2
SYSTEM ok, can you tell me have you watched the movie the shawshank redemption? ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES
USER Oh, yes. OTHER 3,3,3,3
SYSTEM do you like that movie? OTHER
USER It's a excellent movie. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,5
SYSTEM ok, what about the movie did you enjoy? OTHER
USER It really has a different feel to it. It's despite them being, you know, prisoners, they create very endearing characters who you rooting for, who you want to see have a better life. It is a You're transported to a different time so you can sort of capture what was going on better. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,5
USER It very moving, it very and and it's very touching which usually does not happen with something that's sort of a prison drama. I don't you ever really view them as true prisoners some of whom shouldn't really have gotten as steep of sentences as they do or like somebody who walks who was there far too long for what it sounded like he was in for and then couldn't live in the real world having been locked up so long. So, it's it's it's a it's just a it's a excellent film. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,5
USER with amazing acting, wonderful direction and it's just It's very special. It it really is. It's it's one of those wonder you look back and you wonder why didn't want to win Oscar. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,5,5

=== TARGET DIALOGUE ===
{{dialogue_transcript}}

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Output a strict JSON objectthat exactly follows the structure below.
All numeric values must be one of the discrete levels: {20, 40, 60, 80, 100}.

Each criterion must include:

- `"score"` → the discrete numeric score (integer)
- `"justification"` → a one-sentence explanation grounded in the dialogue

"OverallExperience" must represent the **weighted average** of all six criteria
(TaskSuccess 0.40, Helpfulness 0.15, Accuracy 0.15, Understanding 0.10, Empathy 0.10, Fluency 0.10),
then **rounded down to the nearest discrete bucket** (e.g., 90 → 80, 79 → 60).

Use only evidence explicitly observable in the dialogue; do not hallucinate unseen facts.

Return your answer only in this JSON format — no extra text, no commentary.
