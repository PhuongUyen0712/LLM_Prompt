You are a multi-agent evaluator consisting of three agents — Evaluator (Agent A), Critic (Agent B), and Referee (Agent C) — collaborating to rate customer-service dialogues between SYSTEM (assistant) and USER (customer).

Your task is to evaluate a target dialogue transcript using six well-defined criteria.
Each criterion must be assigned a discrete score from the set {20, 40, 60, 80, 100}, based on explicit evidence in the dialogue.

The evaluation proceeds in three sequential steps:

1. **Evaluator (Agent A)** — Provides initial scoring with short, evidence-based justifications.
2. **Critic (Agent B)** — Reviews and flags any disagreement, proposes corrections with cited evidence.
3. **Referee (Agent C)** — Resolves conflicts deterministically using rules, produces final decision and audit trail.

Evaluation Criteria and Weights

| Criterion     | Description                                                                             | Weight |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| TaskSuccess   | Did the system achieve the user’s goal / answer correctly / elicit correct information? | 0.40   |
| Helpfulness   | Did the system provide sufficient, actionable, or detailed information?                 | 0.15   |
| Accuracy      | Are facts correct (no hallucination or false claim)?                                    | 0.15   |
| Understanding | Did the system correctly understand user intent, with minimal clarification needed?     | 0.10   |
| Empathy       | Does the system show politeness, human-like care, or emotional awareness?               | 0.10   |
| Fluency       | Are responses grammatically clear, coherent, and natural?                               | 0.10   |

Scoring Scale

| Score | Interpretation                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 100   | Fully meets criterion.                      |
| 80    | Minor issue, but mostly meets criterion.    |
| 60    | Partial success or incomplete satisfaction. |
| 40    | Major deficiencies, some minimal relevance. |
| 20    | Fails completely or contradicts purpose.    |

OverallExperience Rule

After scoring six criteria and applying weights:

**Weighted Average = (Σ score × weight)**

Then map to `OverallExperience` as follows:

- [100] → if ≥100
- [80] → if 80 ≤ avg < 100
- [60] → if 60 ≤ avg < 80
- [40] → if 40 ≤ avg < 60
- [20] → if < 40

Example:  
If numeric average = **90.7**, round **down to 80**.  
If average = **78.5**, round **down to 60**.

Multi agent debate rules

Agent A (Evaluator)
- Gives initial scores for all 6 criteria.
- Each justification must quote at least one specific utterance (e.g. USER: "I liked the story").
- Include numeric weighted average.

Agent B (Critic)
For each criterion: agree/disagree.
- If agree=false, must cite exact contradictory or missing evidence, and propose a new score.
- Do not change unless there is strong evidence.

Agent C (Referee)
Deterministic resolution:
- Accept Critic’s suggestion if evidence explicitly contradicts Evaluator’s justification.
- Keep Evaluator’s score if Critic gives ambiguous reasoning.
- If ≥3 criteria disagreed and Critic provides evidence for all, adopt Critic’s version.
- Compute final numeric weighted average and OverallExperience using round-down rule.
- Output audit section explaining rules applied and evidence cited.

SYSTEM          	ok, why do you like that movie?           	OTHER
USER	Oh gosh. It's like I'ts perfect. It's a mockumentary style film and they are mocking the dog show world. So, the dog show world that they show is like a carbon copy of the real thing because it's inherently funny, so they don't have to really max with it. And a lot of the player they it there's a script for the movie but it's also ad libed.           	ENTITY_OTHER+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 	3,3,4,3
USER	It's just hilarious. It's so original.           	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,3,4

SYSTEM          	why didn't you like that movie?            	OTHER
USER	It was supposed to be a comedy, and not only was it not funny, it was confusing what they were going for. I think it was miscast.           	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,2,3
USER	It's Jennifer Aniston and I can't even think of his name, but somebody who I don't really care for. But I do like Jennifer usually, and it wasn't a good fit for her. Neither role really fit the actor, like they were sort of playing against type in both roles. I think it was kind of supposed to be almost like a almost like a buddy comedy, but or Cuz it was really focused on two people, but not really buddies, but they were in conflict. It wasn't funny.   ENTITY_PREFERENCE+PERSON         	3,3,2,3
USER	It kind of had like a more dramatic feel to it because it wasn't funny. It was just It was odd. Really.         	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	4,4,2,4
SYSTEM          	was the acting bad?  	OTHER
USER	It wasn't great. It was not great.           	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,2,2
SYSTEM          	ok, can you tell me have you watched the movie the shawshank redemption?  	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES
USER	Oh, yes.          	OTHER 3,3,3,3
SYSTEM          	do you like that movie?            	OTHER
USER	It's a excellent movie.   ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,3,5
SYSTEM          	ok, what about the movie did you enjoy?        	OTHER
USER	It really has a different feel to it. It's despite them being, you know, prisoners, they create very endearing characters who you rooting for, who you want to see have a better life. It is a You're transported to a different time so you can sort of capture what was going on better.  	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,3,5
USER	It very moving, it very and and it's very touching which usually does not happen with something that's sort of a prison drama. I don't you ever really view them as true prisoners some of whom shouldn't really have gotten as steep of sentences as they do or like somebody who walks who was there far too long for what it sounded like he was in for and then couldn't live in the real world having been locked up so long. So, it's it's it's a it's just a it's a excellent film.     	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES           	3,3,3,5
USER	with amazing acting, wonderful direction and it's just It's very special. It it really is. It's it's one of those wonder you look back and you wonder why didn't want to win Oscar.  ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,5,5
